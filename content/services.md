> Denver Ghost Hunters offers a positive environment for members and clients. We are supportive of budget ghost hunting and try and offer the most reasonable equipment and activities.  We accept everyone, though we do have strict policies for behavior on investigations.  We offer security and longivity. Many groups come and go, but the ghost hunters in this group have experience of more than 10 years, and have investigated more than 500 national sites.
