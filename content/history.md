Denver Ghost Hunters was started in 2006 as meet up group, but there was very little interest. The group was put on hold until 2007. The founders, Elise and Stephanie decided that they wanted to create a ghost hunter community to introduce and educate people new to the field and collaborate with other investigators. It was then determined that it would be a social group for this purpose. Now three years later and over 400 members, Denver Ghost Hunters is one of the leading paranormal groups in the field. DHG members travel the country, connecting with other ghost hunting groups investigating a variety of places from haunted houses to businesses, to historic locations. But Colorado is where they will always call home.

The group was envisioned by Elise and her best friend Stephanie, who met on an out of town investigation. They continue to work together, exploring ideas and opportunities in this diverse field.
